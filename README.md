# Free Time For All

A personal project of mine to make coordinating free time easier in large friend groups with conflicting schedules.

## Getting Started

Simply import the project into your IDE as a Maven project. Since this project is based on Spring Boot, you won't need to configure a server to host it. Simply run it!
