# Free Time For All

A personal project of mine to make coordinating free time easier in large friend groups with conflicting schedules.

## Getting Started

Simply import the project into your IDE as a Maven project. Since this project is based on Spring Boot, you won't need to configure a server to host it. Simply run it!

## Built With

[Spring](https://spring.io/) - Specifically Spring Boot
[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Project management
[Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) - Java templating tool
